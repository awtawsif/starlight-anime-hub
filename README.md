## 🛠️ Technologies Used

### Backend

- **Python 3.x**
- **Flask:** Web framework for building the application's routes and logic.
- **Flask-Caching:** Adds caching support to Flask applications.
- **Requests:** For making HTTP requests to external APIs and web scraping.
- **curl_cffi:** Async HTTP client with impersonation support for reliable API calls.
- **BeautifulSoup4 & LXML:** Powerful libraries for parsing HTML content and extracting data.
- **Gunicorn:** WSGI HTTP Server for deploying the Flask application.

### Frontend

- **HTML5:** Structure of the web pages.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development and responsive design.
- **Vanilla JavaScript:** For interactive elements, API calls, and client-side logic (e.g., bookmarking, modals).
- **@vercel/analytics:** Privacy-friendly analytics for tracking page views and engagement.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.8+**
- **pip** (Python package installer)
- **Node.js & npm** (Node Package Manager) - Required for Tailwind CSS build process.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/awtawsif/starlight-anime-hub.git
    cd starlight-anime-hub
    ```

2.  **Set up Python Backend:**

    a. Create a virtual environment (recommended):

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    ```

    b. Activate the virtual environment:

    - On macOS/Linux:
      ```bash
      source .venv/bin/activate
      ```
    - On Windows:
      ```bash
      .venv\Scripts\activate
      ```

    c. Install Python dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Set up Frontend (Tailwind CSS):**

    a. Install Node.js dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    b. Build the production CSS (this will generate `starlight/static/css/tailwind.css`):

    ```bash
    npm run build:css
    ```

    - For development, you can use `npm run watch:css` to automatically recompile CSS on changes.

### Running the Application

1.  **Ensure your Python virtual environment is activated.**
2.  **Start the Flask application:**

    ```bash
    gunicorn run:app
    ```

    (For local development, you can also run `python run.py` but `gunicorn` is recommended for production-like testing.)

3.  **Access the application:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` (or the address Gunicorn specifies).

## 💡 Usage

- **Search:** Use the search bar in the navigation to find anime by title.
- **Browse Airing Anime:** The homepage displays currently airing anime. Use the pagination at the bottom to navigate through pages.
- **View Details:** Click on any anime card to view its detailed page, including synopsis, cast, and related titles.
- **Episode Selection & Download:** From an anime's detail page or the airing anime cards, click on an episode to see options to view details or download.
- **Bookmarks:** Click the star icon on anime cards to bookmark them. Access your bookmarks from the navigation bar.

## 🚀 Deployment

This project is configured for easy deployment on various platforms.

### Heroku

The `Procfile` specifies how to run the application on Heroku:

```
web: gunicorn run:app
```

Ensure your Heroku application is configured with a Python buildpack and the necessary environment variables.

### Vercel

The `vercel.json` file provides configuration for deployment on Vercel:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "run.py",
      "use": "@vercel/python",
      "config": {
        "maxLambdaSize": "15mb",
        "runtime": "python3.9"
      }
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/run.py"
    }
  ]
}
```

This configuration tells Vercel to use the `@vercel/python` builder for `run.py` with Python 3.9.
